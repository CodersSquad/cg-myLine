# Draw a line in [Procesing](https://processing.org/)

- Choose a line drawing algorithm from http://graphx-chlg1.obedmr.com/ and implement your `myLine(x1, y1, x2, y2)` function
- Implement it in Processing, take a look in the [point()](https://processing.org/reference/point_.html) function. You're not allowed to use the `line()` function
- Processing support Python and JavaScript, use the language of your choice, make sure it works and submit it here as `myLine.py` or `myLine.js`
